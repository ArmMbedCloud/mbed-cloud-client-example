#Note

The mbed_cloud_dev_credentials.c file will need an additional variable for LWM2M CA, until it the process does that automatically.
The variable for integration lab CA is defined in integration_lab_lwm2m_root_ca.c

The full documentation for this example is [available on our documentation site](https://cloud.mbed.com/docs/current/connecting/mbed-cloud-client-tutorials.html)
